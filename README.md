# Demonstration of Python's `pickle` vulnerabilities
This is a simple demonstration of the dangers of using pickle to deserialize unknown objects.

There are 2 scripts: the good client with no bad intentions and the evil client which means harm. These scripts uses `pickle` in order to serialize data for the server to deserialize.

## Description
Running `python malware/good_client.py` will create a `data.bkp` file containing some encrypted data. Then running the server script `python malware/server.py` will decrypt and deserialize the file to show its contents.

On the other hand, running `python malware/evil_client.py` will create the same `data.bkp` file, but this time there is a hacking mechanism which will trigger when the server deserializes the file. It's nothing harmful, it will just execute `/bin/sh` on a new process. This shows that we can run arbitrary shell commands on the server, with some tweaks we can even open remote shell connections and do whatever we want.
